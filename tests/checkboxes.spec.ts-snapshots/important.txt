Why Playwright fails on this screenshot
───────────────────────────────────────
• The baseline image in this repo was generated on Windows (`*-win32.png`).
• GitHub Actions runs on Ubuntu, so Playwright looks for `*-linux.png`.
  When it can’t find that file, it throws “Snapshot doesn't exist”.

How to avoid the mismatch
1. Use the *same OS/container* locally and in CI (recommended), OR
2. Generate both baselines once:
     npx playwright test --update-snapshots   # inside your CI OS
   then commit the new   checkboxes-after-check-chromium-linux.png
3. Skip the screenshot in CI:
     if (!process.env.CI) await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('...');

Playwright adds the platform suffix automatically.  
Matching the filename to the runner’s OS (or committing both variants) keeps tests green.
